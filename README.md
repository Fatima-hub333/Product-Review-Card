## My process
I create html template first after that I started stylin components one by one.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned media queries via solving this challenge as it has different layout for mobile screen & desktop screen. So yeah it's amazing I learned new things how to use media queries using different screen widths. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
